    <article>
      <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I am JEFBECKER. Some people call me Jeferson, others call me Becker, so when I had to choose my first username in 2009, I decided to combine both. Since then, this has been my "identity" on the internet.</p>
      <p>I am an accountant, so I really like accounting and personal finance, but I'm also interested in technology. I got into the habit of watching anime every season since 2018 (before that, I would only watch something occasionally if it happened to be popular at the time). I also read some manga and try to read various books. I say "try" because I have some difficulty consuming longer reads. <a href="/pages/about/#lists">Everything I watch/read is recorded in my lists</a>, if you want to check them out.</p>
      <h2 id="about-the-website">About the Website</h2>
      <p>This website is my personal space on the internet, free from the constraints of social networks, algorithms, etc. Every line of code here was written by me (after a lot of trial and error) and/or with the help of various tutorials and by peeking at the source code of other pages to figure out how they did "that thing." I never thought about having a website, and I don't remember exactly when the idea came up, but the initial goal was to get rid of <a href="https://linktr.ee/jefbecker">Linktree</a>. I used to put the lists of what I watch and/or read on different platforms there. It was the solution I found to display these lists like a bulletin board, but I never really liked the idea.</p>
      <p>Around 2015, I started feeling a growing but slow desire to distance myself from social networks. Since I was never very "social" to begin with, it wasn't hard to erase the few traces I had left and delete my profiles one by one. In 2021, I discovered Neocities and decided to create a page. At first, everything was very archaic and difficult to do because I had no knowledge of HTML and CSS, but little by little, I learned. This website has gone through several terrible versions (all quite similar), but I believe the current version is very good, considering the responsive design and the attention I've given to accessibility. This site only exists thanks to free tutorials on the internet, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://neocities.org/tutorials">Learn How to Make Websites!</a></strong> - A tutorial from Neocities for creating websites;</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/about/default.asp">W3 Schools</a></strong> - Various development tutorials.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, I clarified many doubts with <a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
      <p>This website was made to last. It was developed with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Mobile_First">mobile-first</a> approach to ensure a good experience on any screen while meeting minimum accessibility requirements. The entire structure was planned so that I can simply take everything with me in a folder if I ever need to change hosting.</p>
      <h2 id="inspirations">Inspirations</h2>
      <p>I had many inspirations along the way, rediscovering what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 1.0 and 2.0</a> were (unfortunately, I wasn't able to participate in the first one) and learning about <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/692445/remembering-geocities-the-1990s-precursor-to-social-media/">Geocities</a>. Additionally, I found many people who have their own websites, part of what is called the <a href="https://indieweb.org">Indieweb</a>. Below are some of these inspirations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">This Page is Design to Last, by Jeff Huang</a></strong> - A manifesto about content on the internet and its fragile (or even nonexistent) preservation. Fun or informative pages, forum comments, entire websites, images, videos, things we save to read later, everything can disappear incredibly easily. Part of the blame comes from the excessive complexity that everything seems to require. The text isn't perfect, but it was because of it that I decided to create something built to last, with longevity in mind.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">This is a motherfucking website</a> and <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website</a></strong> - Two layers of satire: the first demonstrates how a simple webpage can be created with minimal effort, and the second shows how CSS makes everything more visually appealing and pleasant. I really enjoy the passive-aggressive approach these sites use to illustrate something people seem to have forgotten: what makes a good website.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241214200233/https://startafuckingblog.com/">Start a Fucking Blog, by Kev Quirk</a></strong> - Following the passive-aggressive tone of the two examples above, this site is also an example, but this time about blogs. These spaces have also faded over time, yet they still hold an important role: not relying on the "walled gardens" that big tech companies have built with their social networks over the years. Blogs have no algorithms, no ads or tracking (most of the time), no barriers preventing visitors from accessing public content just because they don't have an account, and so on. The list of obstacles is endless, and I don't like any of it.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://crieaporradeum.blog">Crie a Porra de um Blog</a>, by <a href="https://www.gmgall.net/">Guilherme Magalhães Gall</a></strong> - GO BRAZIL!!!!! The Brazilian version of "Start a Fucking Blog," since the original no longer exists. Remember when I talked about longevity? Well... <blockquote><em>
              <p>"This site is a translation/adaptation of the - now defunct - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241214200233/https://startafuckingblog.com/">Start a Fucking Blog</a> by <a href="https://kevquirk.com/">Kev Quirk</a>, which was itself influenced by <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Motherfucking Website</a> and <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">Better Motherfucking Website</a>.</p>
              <p>Despite the humorous tone and use of strong language, the message behind this site is serious. The <a href="https://thewebisfucked.com/">modern web is fucked</a>. It has become <a href="https://www.gmgall.net/blog/tchau-twitter/#n%C3%A3o-quero-uma-web-centralizada">extremely centralized</a> around a few private platforms. This is terrible for users.</p>
              <p>Own your content. <strong>Start a fucking blog."</strong></p>
            </em></blockquote>
