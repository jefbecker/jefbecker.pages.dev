    <article>
      <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm JEFBECKER. Some people call me Jeferson, others Becker, so when I needed to choose my first username in 2009, I decided to combine the two. Since then, this has been my "identity" on the internet.</p>
      <p>I am an Accountant. I completed college, a technical course, and have been working in the field since 2011, not necessarily in that order. I took a break from studies and work in 2012 due to mandatory military service. It was a lost year, but it resulted in about four friends, some stories, and an aversion to patriotism.</p>
      <h2 id="about-the-website">About the Website</h2>
      <p>This website is my personal space on the internet, free from the constraints of social networks, algorithms, etc. Every line of code here was either made by me (often scratching my head) and/or with the help of various tutorials. I confess that I also peek at the source code of other pages to see how they did "that thing." It's an old idea that I don't exactly remember when it came up, but the main goal has always been to get rid of the <a href="https://linktr.ee/jefbecker">Linktree.</a> I used to put lists of what I watch and/or read on various platforms there. It was the solution I found to display these lists as a bulletin board, but I never liked the idea much.</p>
      <p>Around 2015, I began to have a growing but slow desire to distance myself from social networks. Since I was never very "social," it wasn't difficult to erase the few traces I left and gradually delete my profiles one by one. In 2021, I discovered Neocities and started learning more about a more open, free, and accessible internet. Everything pointed towards a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)">self-hosted</a> approach, and after reading a lot about its benefits, I realized I couldn't simply host my own content.</p>
      <p>Despite not being able to host a website on my own, I found several free options that would help me with that. After that, I just had to learn how to make a website. Fortunately, this is a well-documented subject out there. This website exists thanks to free tutorials on the internet, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://neocities.org/tutorials">Learn How to Make Websites!</a></strong> - A tutorial from Neocities for creating websites;</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/about/default.asp">W3 Schools</a></strong> - Various development tutorials.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, I clarified many doubts with <a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
      <p>This website was made to last, developed with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Mobile_First">mobile-first</a> approach to ensure a good experience on any screen, meeting minimum accessibility requirements. The entire structure was planned so that I can simply take everything with me in a folder if I need to change hosts.</p>
      <h2 id="inspirations">Inspirations</h2>
      <p>Throughout my rediscovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">WEB 1.0 and 2.0</a> (which I unfortunately was unable to participate in) and what was <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/692445/remembering-geocities-the-1990s-precursor-to-social-media/">Geocities</a>, I had several inspirations that finally made me create my own space on the internet:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">This Page is Design to Last, by Jeff Huang</a></strong> - A manifesto about internet content and its fragile (or even nonexistent) preservation. Like Jeff, I also cleaned up my browser favorites and realized that several links simply didn't work anymore. Fun or informative pages, forum comments, entire websites, things I saved to read later, etc. Everything can be lost very easily, and part of the blame is on the exaggerated complexity that everything needs to have. The text is not perfect, but it was because of it that I concluded that I could create something that lasts. I created this website thinking about its longevity, simplicity, and consequently, accessibility - it's amazing how a website can be more accessible just by being simpler;</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">This is a motherfucking website</a> and <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website</a></strong> - Two satires on two levels: the first shows how a simple page of a website can be made with the minimum effort possible, and the second, how applying just a little effort makes everything more beautiful and pleasant. I really like the passive-aggressive approach these sites use to illustrate something that people apparently forgot: how a good website should be;</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://startafuckingblog.com">Start a Fucking Blog, by Kev Quirk</a></strong> - Following the passive-aggressive line of the two examples above, this website is also an example, but this time about blogs. Places that also got lost over time but still play a very important role: not depending on the "walled gardens" that the big tech companies built with their social networks over the years. Blogs don't have algorithms, ads, and tracking (sometimes), no panel preventing the visitor from accessing something public because they don't have an account, and so on. The list of obstacles is endless, and I don't like any of it;</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging">Bring Back Personal Blogging, on The Verge</a></strong> - An interesting article that summarizes all the reasons mentioned earlier.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="personal-preferences">Personal Preferences</h2>
      <p>Perhaps my profession doesn't give it away, but I like accounting. Especially personal finance. I'm also interested in technology - it's no wonder I'm enjoying making this website more than putting content on it. In early 2018, I started watching anime for real. Before that, I only watched something sporadic that was popular at the time. I also read some manga and try to read various books. I say "try" because I have a certain difficulty in consuming longer readings. I like comedy series and the infamous "hero movies." It's all on my lists if you want to see.</p>
