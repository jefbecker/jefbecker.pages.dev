    <p>This week, I completed the final steps needed for the website to be "100%." I acquired a '.com' domain and became a supporter of Neocities. Having a domain wasn't something I considered much, but in three days, I gathered information and ended up convinced that it was a very good and relatively inexpensive idea. Supporting the "home" of this website wasn't in the plans, but I liked it so much here that I decided to give it a try. Now, canceling the support is not in the plans.</p>
    <h2>With Great Domains comes Great Spam</h2>
    <p>I'm not sure how much this is related to the new domain, but I started receiving more dubious spam in the email I left for contact. It's not really a problem since this email was specifically made for that. However, having to change this email frequently on each page where it is found will be unfeasible going forward: this website is static, each page is made individually, and the more pages there are, the more changes will have to be made. With that in mind, I decided to change the structure a bit by creating pages for specific topics. With this, I can easily change the email on its <a href="https://jefbecker.com/pages/contact/">own page.</a></p>
    <p>But back to the spam, the proposals I received were somewhat absurd, not because they were clearly scams, but for pointing out supposed flaws on this website and offering "better things," a new design, and so on.</p>
    <p>I was already preparing to channel my inner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Veitch_(comedian)">James Veitch</a> and respond in the most creative ways that I can only think of when I'm unable to write them down. But I thought twice and gave up. It's not worth it and would be too much work. Maybe when I have more time.</p>
    <h2>This Website is Already Perfect</h2>
    <p>I thought a bit about this, whether this was really the website format I would like to have. But everything indicates that yes, at least for now. This website is perfect as it is: simple, responsive, lightweight, and because of that, it has even scored some points in accessibility. <a href="/feed/rss.xml">It even has RSS!</a> There are plenty of big sites that don't even bother with that...</p>
